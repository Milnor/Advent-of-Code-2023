# ðŸŽ„ Advent-of-Code-2023 ðŸŽ„

* TODO: cover art, once a clear theme emerges

My favorite annual coding competition. Will this be the year I finally complete it?  

## Usage
As of day 2, there are no dependencies.
```
./solver.py
```

## Misc
* I'm developing on an Ubuntu 22.04 machine running Python 3.10
* While I doubt anyone cares to copy my solutions, in the interest of avoiding spoilers, I'm not pushing code for day *n* until day *n+1*

## TODO
* [ ] Day 5 Part 2 is a disaster. Fix it.
